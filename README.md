### MediHome Channeling System ###

>>> Project Overview <<<

MediHome Channeling is a full-stack web application developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It is designed to enhance access to healthcare services by allowing patients—especially the elderly, disabled, or those living in rural areas—to book medical consultations and home visits online.
This system addresses inefficiencies in traditional healthcare appointment processes by providing a centralized and user friendly platform for patients, doctors, and administrative staff to manage medical channeling efficiently.
